# Challenge-1

## Description


I was given the task of updating an existing site from a marketing agency to have a codebase that follows accessibilty standards so that the site is optimized for search engines. 

This project was motivation in itself, as accessibilty is something that is very importatnt to me. It was a great exercise to reinforce what we learned in class, as well as expand on that knowledge by reseaching adequate semantic html use. The changes made the website much more accessible, the code itself is much easier to understand visually and the alt text allows screen readers to interperet images for vision impaired users. See below screenshots for sompleted site.
